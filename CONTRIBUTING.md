# Contributing patterns and components

If you think a pattern or component should be included in the system, first discuss it with the design community on Slack or in GitHub.

You can see our backlog of patterns and components on [GitHub](https://github.com/UKHomeOffice/home-office-digital-patterns/projects/1). To suggest a new pattern or component please [create an issue](https://github.com/UKHomeOffice/home-office-digital-patterns/issues).

Add the following information to the issue:

*   the need the pattern/component meets
*   why you think it should be included in the design system
*   any example screenshots from other services
*   any user research

The Design System Working Group will move it into the backlog column and review. They may decide that another pattern meets the need better.

## Stages

If the Working Group agree that it is needed, it will move through the following stages:

### Experimental

We've seen this problem in an area and it's being peer reviewed by the team and iterated upon. The pattern may change quite a lot in Experimental. Teams are free to use this pattern in their own prototypes by adding a comment to say that they will be using it. Please report back any research findings. It should not be used in production.

### Recommended

We've seen this pattern work consistently in testing and are recommending its use. **If you've found a user need** and this pattern meets it, please use this version. On occasion we may recommend a pattern or component due to the need for consistency.
