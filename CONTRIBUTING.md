# Contributing to the system

We value all contributions to the design system.

You can discuss patterns and components that are already in the backlog or system on Slack, email, in person or on GitHub.

You can suggest a new or missing pattern or component by [creating an issue](https://github.com/UKHomeOffice/home-office-digital-patterns/issues) in GitHub. Or by contacting our team at [design@digital.homeoffice.gov.uk](mailto:design@digital.homeoffice.gov.uk).

## Stages of a new pattern/component
A Design System Working Group review new contributions. They may decide that something else meets the need better. If the Working Group agree that a pattern/component is needed, it will move through the following stages:

### Experimental

We've seen this problem in an area and it's being peer reviewed by the team and iterated upon. It may change a lot in Experimental. Teams are free to use it in their own prototypes. Please report back any research findings. It should not be used in production.

### Recommended

We've seen this work consistently in testing and are recommending its use. If you've found a user need and this pattern or component meets it, please use this version. On occasion we may recommend a pattern or component due to the need for consistency.
