      <p>If you think a pattern or component should be included in the system, first discuss it with the design community on Slack or in GitHub.</p>

      <p>You can see our backlog of patterns and components on <a href="https://github.com/UKHomeOffice/home-office-digital-patterns/projects/1">GitHub</a>. To suggest a new pattern or component please <a href="https://github.com/UKHomeOffice/home-office-digital-patterns/issues">create an issue</a>. </p>

      <p>Add the following information to the issue:</p>

      <ul class="list list-bullet">
        <li>the need the pattern/component meets</li>
        <li>why you think it should be included in the design system</li>
        <li>any example screenshots from other services</li>
        <li>any user research</li>
      </ul>

      <p>The Design System Working Group will move it into the backlog column and review. They may decide that another pattern meets the need better.</p>

      <h2 class="heading-medium">Stages</h2>
      <p>If the Working Group agree that it is needed, it will move through the following stages:</p>

      <h3 class="heading-small">Experimental</h3>
      <p>We've seen this problem in an area and it's being peer reviewed by the team and iterated upon. The pattern may change quite a lot in Experimental. Teams are free to use this pattern in their own prototypes by adding a comment to say that they will be using it. Please report back any research findings. It should not be used in production.</p>

      <h3 class="heading-small">Recommended</h3>
      <p>We've seen this pattern work consistently in testing and are recommending its use. <strong class="bold">If you've found a user need</strong> and this pattern meets it, please use this version. On occasion we may recommend a pattern or component due to the need for consistency.</p>
