      <p>We value all contributions to the design system.</p>

      <p>You can discuss patterns and components that are already in the backlog or system on Slack, email, in person or on <a href="https://github.com/UKHomeOffice/home-office-digital-patterns/projects/1">GitHub</a>.</p>

      <p>You can suggest a new or missing pattern or component by <a href="https://github.com/UKHomeOffice/home-office-digital-patterns/issues">creating an issue in GitHub</a>. Or by contacting our team at <a href="mailto:design@digital.homeoffice.gov.uk">design@digital.homeoffice.gov.uk</a>.</p>

      <h2 class="heading-medium">Stages of a new pattern/component</h2>
      <p>A Design System Working Group review new contributions. They may decide that something else meets the need better. If the Working Group agree that a pattern/component is needed, it will move through the following stages:</p>

      <h3 class="heading-small">Experimental</h3>
      <p>We've seen this problem in an area and it's being peer reviewed by the team and iterated upon. It may change a lot in Experimental. Teams are free to use it in their own prototypes. Please report back any research findings. It should not be used in production.</p>

      <h3 class="heading-small">Recommended</h3>
      <p>We've seen this work consistently in testing and are recommending its use. If you've found a user need and this pattern or component meets it, please use this version. On occasion we may recommend a pattern or component due to the need for consistency.</p>
