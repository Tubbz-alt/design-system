      <h2 class="heading-medium">Interaction principles</h2>
      <p>Only one tab can be active at a time.</p>
      <p>The active tab should be distinguishable from the inactive, with maximum contrast ratio.</p>
      <p>Inactive tabs should have a hover state that is distinguisable with minimum contrast ratio.</p>
      <p>Focused tabs should be consistent with other focus states and distinguisable from active, inactive and hover states.</p>
      <p><a href="https://inclusive-components.design/tabbed-interfaces/">Inclusive components</a> has some really good guidance on tabs if you want to read more.</p>

      <h2 class="heading-medium">Content principles</h2>
      <p>The label should reflect the thing you need do with the content of that tab, not a description of what it is.</p>

      <h2 class="heading-medium">Accessibility principles</h2>
      <p>The active tab should be labelled as active in the code.</p>
      <p>Only active tab content should be readable.</p>

      <h2 class="heading-medium">User research</h2>
      <p>Syrian refugee resettlement found no problems with tabs. Users have a good understanding of what to expect from them.</p>
      <p>Dyslexic users were ignoring the tabs. So the line around the tabs were made thicker and the blue links were underlined to avoid this issue.</p>
      <p>Returns and movements found users missed the inactive tab. They think that might be due to content but its worth keeping an eye on.</p>

        <li>Syrian refugee resettlement</li>
