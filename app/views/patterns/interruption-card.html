      <h2 class="heading-medium">Why have we created this pattern?</h2>
      <p>No GDS pattern is available</p>

      <h2 class="heading-medium">Interaction principles</h2>
      <p>An interruption card should be used to draw the attention of the user to some important information specific to that point in their journey.</p>
      <p>Cards should have headings. You may want to hide the heading but it&rsquo;s generally simpler not to.</p>
      <p>One thing per card. If the user needs to do more than one thing, use extra cards.</p>
      <p>Use larger text (24px) than in the rest of the journey.</p>
      <p>Use a &ldquo;Continue&rdquo; button to advance to the next card or page.</p>
      <p>Don&rsquo;t use form elements (except buttons) within cards. Form elements will add extra complexity and you will need to deal with error states.</p>

      <h2 class="heading-medium">User research</h2>
      <p>Interruption cards have proved successful at getting users to read important information which they might skip if presented on a start page. This pattern has been so successful on the passport renewals service that we have been able to dramatically reduce the amount of content on the start page.</p>

      <p>Interrupting users&rsquo; flow in this way can increase their understanding and retention of important information.</p>

      <h2 class="heading-medium">Accessibility principles</h2>
      <p>The colours used have been proved to be a better contrast for people with dyslexia</p>
