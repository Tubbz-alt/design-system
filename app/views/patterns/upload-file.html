      <!-- <h2 class="heading-medium">Why document this pattern?</h2>
      <p>This pattern gives teams a broad starting point if they find a user need to upload files.</p> -->

      <h2 class="heading-medium">Guidance</h2>
      <h3 class="heading-small">It can be used:</h3>
      <ul class="list list-bullet">
        <li>to upload single files</li>
        <li>to upload multiple files</li>
        <li>for a range of file types</li>
      </ul>

      <h3 class="heading-small">It should not be used:</h3>

      <ul class="list list-bullet">
        <li>in some internal services where there is a need for bulk uploading</li>
      </ul>

      <h3 class="heading-small">The upload pattern should:</h3>
      <ul class="list list-bullet">
        <li>replay the file clearly to reduce user error</li>
        <li>have flexibility so users can change their minds</li>
        <li>allow the user to skip the process if allowed</li>
      </ul>

      <!-- <h2 class="heading-medium">Interactions using this pattern</h2>
      <ul class="list list-bullet">
        <li>Entering a recipient&rsquo;s email address</li>
