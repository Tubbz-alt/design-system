      <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">It can be used:</h3>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>to find a single address</li>
        <li>to add an address manually</li>
        <li>as part of a loop to add multiple addresses</li>
      </ul>

      <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">It should not be used:</h3>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>if the address is needed as structured data</li>
      </ul>

      <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">The postcode lookup pattern should:</h3>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>replay the address options clearly</li>
        <li>give the user flexibility to add an address in different ways</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">User research</h2>
      <ul class="list">
        <li>Users living in new-build accomodation who knew their address wouldn't be found had no problem with free text input.</li>
