      <p class="govuk-body-l">Allow users to leave a service at the right time.</p>

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m" style="margin-top: 0.5em;">How to use these patterns</h2>
      <p>Do research to understand at what point in a service a user will need to leave.</p>
      <p>For public-facing services it may be better to describe it as leaving a service rather then signing out. Users might not feel they have signed in to a service.</p>
      <p>Only give users the option to leave mid-service if they can save progress and carry on with the service at another time.</p>
      <p>Consider the environment users will use your service.</p>

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">In page</h2>
      <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">When to use this pattern</h3>
      <p>When a user comes to a certain point in your service and the most important action is to leave. This can still be used with a persistent link elsewhere.</p>
      <p>At the end of a service.</p>
      <p>When a user is likely to be working from a public space and is inputting sensitive data.</p>

The sign out link is a button with the text 'Finish and leave service'.">

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Under header</h2>
      <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">When to use this pattern</h3>
      <p>When signing out of a service is best practice but not crucial for the user.</p>
      <img src="{{ asset_path }}/images/signout-underheader.svg" class="confirm-desktop confirm-mobile" style="margin-bottom:3em;" alt="An example service page with a sign-out link under the header on the right of a feedback link.">

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">In header</h2>
      <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">When to use this pattern</h3>
      <p>When signing out of a service isn’t important but users might want to - for example they share a workspace.</p>
      <p>This pattern is more likely to be used on multi-use and caseworking services.</p>
      <img src="{{ asset_path }}/images/signout-inheader.svg" class="confirm-desktop" style="margin-bottom:3em;" alt="An example service page with a sign-out link in the header on the right of GOV.UK and the crown.">

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">After leaving the service</h2>
      <p>Take users to a confirmation page that includes:</p>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>a confirmation that the sign out has been successful</li>
        <li>gives them the option to sign back in again</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">User research</h2>
      <p>Users are confident in using a 'leave the service' button at the end of a transaction. Users mention they want to make sure they leave a service securely.</p>
