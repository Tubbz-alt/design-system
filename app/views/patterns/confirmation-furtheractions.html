      <p class="govuk-body-l">Use this pattern when the online process is complete but you need to do something else to finish the application, such as send documents by post.</p>

<!-- WHEN TO USE PATTERN -->
      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">When to use this pattern</h2>
      <p>When a user needs to do something else, such as send documents, to complete an application offline. It should explain what the user needs to do, and what happens next in their application.</p>

<!-- HOW IT WORKS - OPTIONAL -->

<!-- SERVICES USING THIS PATTERN  -->
      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Services using this pattern</h2>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>Sponsorship did the initial work but is now paused</li>
      </ul>

<!-- RESEARCH -->
      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Research</h2>
      <p>TThis variation of the confirmation pattern was created as research found that, with the standard GOV.UK confirmation pages, users did not realise that they still had to do something. The standard confirmation page was too final and seen as an end to what the user had to do.</p>
      <p>There was a recurring theme with users doing screenshots of this page for their records, and wanting to know what had happened with their application. The link in the 'request received' box was included to reassure users they could still get access to their information.</p>
      <p>In addition, the link to download the PDF doc was used as a backup, as the user was emailed their documents at the same time. It wasn’t essential that they used this interaction to download their document, but it was good to clarify what the next task was. It allowed them do it straight away, rather than relying on having to go to their emails.</p>

<!-- ACCESSIBILITY -->
            <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Accessibility</h2>
            <p>If your service uses this pattern, we’d be interested to hear any insights you have on any accessibility considerations.</p>
