      <p class="govuk-body-l">Let users access your service in a secure way.</p>

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">When to use authentication</h2>
      <p>Authentication lets users verify who they are.</p>
      <p>Most one-time services won't need to authenticate their users. When a service does need to verify a user’s identity, it needs to balance ease of access with keeping a service and its user data secure. You should think about this early on when designing your service.</p>
      <p>You might want to authenticate users if:</p>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>your service allows users to save and complete a transaction at another time</li>
        <li>a user can check the status of a transaction</li>
        <li>a user will use a service multiple times</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Authentication examples</h2>
      <p>You can authenticate users using reference numbers, personal details, codes sent in SMS and emails, and using GOV.UK Verify. Don’t use National Insurance numbers to verify a user’s identity. <a href="https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/technology/protecting-your-service-against-fraud#protecting-your-service-against-fraud">Further guidance on National Insurance numbers and fraud can be found in the service manual</a>.</p>
      <p>You should consult a Home Office security specialist as they can advise you on the type of authentication that’s right for your service.</p>

          <h2 class="govuk-visually-hidden" id="example-component">Authentication using a reference number</h2>
          <p>A reference number is a simple way to let users access a service. For example when a user saves progress and needs to return to complete a service.</p>

        <div class="example example-images confirmation">
          <h2 class="govuk-visually-hidden" id="example-component">Knowledge based authentication</h2>
          <p>Use knowledge based authentication when you need to confirm a users identity.</p>
          <img src="{{ asset_path }}/images/auth-knowledge-based.svg" class="confirm-desktop" alt="">
          <img src="{{ asset_path }}/images/auth-knowledge-based-mobile.svg" class="confirmation confirm-mobile" alt="">

      <details style="margin-top: 10px;">
        <summary>Example - two-factor authentication</summary>
        <div class="example example-images confirmation">
          <h2 class="govuk-visually-hidden" id="example-component">Two-factor authentication</h2>
          <p>Two-factor authentication can be used when a service stores user data and allows users to access it. Two-factor helps protect the user and the service. There are three types of authentication: something a user knows (password, pin), something a user has (phone, fob), and a biometric like a fingerprint or voice.</p>
          <img src="{{ asset_path }}/images/auth-2factor.svg" class="confirm-desktop" alt="">
          <img src="{{ asset_path }}/images/auth-2factor-mobile.svg" class="confirmation confirm-mobile" alt="">
        </div>
      </details>

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Authentication is not the same as identity assurance</h2>
      <p>Identity assurance confirms the true identity of a user. The checks are usually done before confirming a users suitability for something. Identity assurance can consist of:</p>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>confirming the user is a human</li>
        <li>confirming the validaty of information and documents</li>
        <li>fraud checks</li>
        <li>checking for warnings about a user</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">User accounts</h2>
      <p>User accounts are a form of authentication that you should try to avoid. Services should be public facing and not start behind a user log in. This is essential for users searching for the government service they need.</p>
      <h4 class="govuk-heading-s">Making users create accounts when not needed:</h4>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>creates a barrier for users and can reduce completion rates</li>
        <li>forces users to keep track of more logins then neccesary</li>
        <li>burdens teams with databases that are difficult to build and maintain</li>
        <li>increases the amount of redundant databases - which is expensive and a security risk</li>
      </ul>

      <h4 class="govuk-heading-s">Only make users create an account if:</h4>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>users access a service frequently</li>
        <li>users need it - don't force them to create an account until necessary</li>
        <li>a service needs to audit user behaviour</li>
      </ul>
