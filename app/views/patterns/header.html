    <h2 class="heading-medium">Why have we created this pattern?</h2>
    <p>The <a href="https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/design/add-the-govuk-header-and-footer">GOV.UK header and footer pattern</a> does not meet the user need, especially around internal services.</p>

    <h2 class="heading-medium">Interaction principles</h2>
    <p>The service name should link to the logical starting page; usually the home page of the service.</p>
    <p>If users need to sign in to the service under different roles, ensure the starting page is appropriate for them.</p>
    <p>The header can be used for global actions, for example, Search and Sign out.</p>
    <p>Do not add more than two global actions, unless there is a proven need.</p>


    <h2 class="heading-medium">Content principles</h2>
    <p>The header should be the name of the service. <a href="https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/design/naming-your-service">Find out more about naming your service.</a></p>
    <p>For internal systems, you should only use the ‘Digital by default’ logo if your service has a public-facing element on GOV.UK.</p>
    <p>For internal systems, there is no need to use the GOV.UK blue bar.</p>
    <h2 class="heading-medium">Accessibility principles</h2>
    <p>Label links correctly</p>

    <h2 class="heading-medium">User research</h2>
    <ul class="list list-bullet">
      <li>The service name was not immediately associated with linking to the home page of the service. Either a 'home' link had to be placed explicitly in the header or was factored as part of a breadcrumb trail. </li>
      <li>Users, especially caseworkers, were very task-specific and required core functions to be placed in header along with global actions</li>
      <li>Usernames deemed challenging in some cases due to character length (some being full email addresses); if account is tied to POISE, log-in from POISE would suffice and sign-out was preferred over username as it offered reassurance to users they are leaving the system </li>
      <li>Header kept very minimal because of small singular monitors used to access internal services; where necessary, this may lead to capitalising on header area to place core nav and global items</li>
      <li>Service names were not verbs but nouns as they cover a range of actions</li>
    </ul>

  <h2 class="heading-medium">Pattern is missing</h2>
  <ul class="list list-bullet">
    <li>considerations for mobile view of service header</li>
