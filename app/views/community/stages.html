      <h1 class="govuk-heading-l">Stages of a pattern and component</h1>
      <p>The Design System team review new contributions. They may decide that something else meets the need better. If the Working Group agree that a pattern/component is needed, it will move through the following stages:</p>

      <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Experimental</h3>
      <p>We've seen this problem in an area and it's being peer reviewed by the team and iterated upon. It may change a lot in Experimental. Teams are free to use it in their own prototypes. Please report back any research findings. It should not be used in production.</p>

      <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Recommended</h3>
      <p>We've seen this work consistently in testing and are recommending its use. If you've found a user need and this pattern or component meets it, please use this version. On occasion we may recommend a pattern or component due to the need for consistency.</p>
