# Home Office design system

## Purpose
Documenting common ways of solving problems - helping to reduce multiplied effort.
Filling the gaps between GDS guidance and Home Office services.

## Indirect benefits:
- a place to share and work in the open
- documenting learnings that would otherwise have been lost (or saved in sharepoint never to be found again)
- creating a common language that people can use when talking about design
- modelling design standards for Home Office individuals and teams 
- one place for designers to look when searching for guidance (outside GDS)
- extra attention to detail

## Problem statement
Individual designers in the Home Office have limited visibility of what others are working on. At the same time there are gaps in the GDS design guidance, particularly around internal services.

Busy designers on projects end up working by themselves on common problems and there is no process for documenting what theyâ€™ve learnt.

At the Home Office the design team is growing and works remotely. So the problem will get bigger over time, with a real danger that silos form.

There's an opportunity to document each pattern we come across so duplicated effort disappears. We learn from others effort, as designers start to solve problems collaboratively. Increasing the opportunities for co-designing, sharing research and supporting one another.
